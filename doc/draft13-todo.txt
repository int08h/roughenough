Review draft 13 vs draft 12

--- DONE ---
DONE, NEEDS TESTING Hash over the entire request packet used in Merkle tree
As another mitigation against version downgrade attacks, the hash value
of the entire request packet, including the ROUGHTIM header, is used for
building the Merkle tree (instead of the NONC value). This means that
any changes to the request packet will cause the client's verification
of the response to fail.

DONE Maximum PATH length introduced
The length of PATH is not limited to 32. This has no effect in practice
(unless someone is signing 2^32 responses at once) and serves to
simplify implementations.

DONE Changed delegation signature context string
During the Hackathon, we discovered that the two dashes at the end of
the delegation signature context string had been removed and then added
again by mistake in a subsequent draft. Since we are already making
breaking changes in this update, we decided to fix this at the same
time. The dashes have once again been removed from the delegation
signature context string.

DONE Sorted values in VER tag
In requests, the version numbers in the VER tag now have to be sorted in
ascending numerical order.

DONE Draft version number changed to 0x8000000c
We have received requests not to change the draft version numbers unless
we make changes to the line protocol. However, since we made breaking
changes in this update, we had to bump the version number.

DONE VER tag moved inside SREP
During the hackathon, we realized that the protocol is vulnerable to
version downgrade attacks. Moving the VER tag inside SREP ensures that
it is authenticated.

DONE VERS tag introduced
The VERS tag has been added to SREP. It provides clients with an
authenticated list of versions supported by the server, making version
downgrade attacks where the attacker selectively drops packets with
certain versions detectable by the client.
