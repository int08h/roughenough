## Versioning Policy

This project aspirationally follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html) and tries to 
adhere to it as closely/practically as possible:

- **MAJOR** version increments indicate incompatible API changes
- **MINOR** version increments add functionality in a backward compatible manner
- **PATCH** version increments make backward compatible bug fixes

Given a version number MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH:
- Breaking changes to public APIs or protocol implementation increment MAJOR
- New features that maintain backward compatibility increment MINOR
- Bug fixes and internal improvements increment PATCH
