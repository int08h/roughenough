# task-10 - Add Changelog and Versioning

## Description

Create a changelog to track all notable changes to the project in a format that is useful for users and contributors. A well-maintained changelog helps users understand what has changed between versions and makes it easier to decide when to upgrade.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] CHANGELOG.md created following Keep a Changelog format
- [x] Document version 2.0.0 changes (initial release or migration from v1)
- [x] Add unreleased section for tracking ongoing changes
- [x] Document semantic versioning policy

## Implementation Plan

1. Review Keep a Changelog format and semantic versioning standards
2. Create CHANGELOG.md following Keep a Changelog format:
   - Add header with project info and format links
   - Add [Unreleased] section for tracking future changes
   - Add [2.0.0] section documenting initial release
   - Include semantic versioning policy explanation
3. Verify all acceptance criteria are satisfied
4. Add implementation notes and mark task complete

## Implementation Notes

### Approach Taken

Created a CHANGELOG.md file following the Keep a Changelog format to establish a foundation for tracking project changes:

1. Followed Keep a Changelog 1.1.0 format specifications
2. Documented version 2.0.0 as the initial release
3. Created placeholder sections in [Unreleased] for categorizing future changes
4. Added comprehensive versioning policy explaining semantic versioning

### Features Implemented

**CHANGELOG.md Structure**:
- Header with links to Keep a Changelog and Semantic Versioning standards
- [Unreleased] section with category placeholders (Added, Changed, Deprecated, Removed, Fixed, Security)
- [2.0.0] section documenting initial release with comprehensive feature list:
  - Core protocol implementation (RFC-compliant Roughtime)
  - Server and client components
  - Key management backends (KRS, SSH agent, PKCS#11, AWS KMS/Secrets, GCP KMS/Secrets)
  - Malfeasance reporting system
  - Testing infrastructure (unit, integration, benchmarks, fuzzing, coverage)
  - Documentation (protocol specs, guides, contributing guidelines, templates)
- Versioning Policy section explaining semantic versioning rules
- Comparison links for GitHub integration

### Technical Decisions

- Used Keep a Changelog format for consistency with industry standards
- Documented 2.0.0 as initial release rather than attempting to list incremental changes (this is new code)
- Included all category sections in [Unreleased] as placeholders for contributors
- Added comprehensive feature list in 2.0.0 to document project capabilities at launch
- Included versioning policy inline (not separate document) for easy reference
- Set date as 2025-10-06 (implementation date) as placeholder for actual release date
- Used GitHub compare links for version comparison support

### Modified Files

- CHANGELOG.md: Created (70 lines)
- tasks/task-10 - Add Changelog and Versioning.md: Added implementation plan and notes, marked all acceptance criteria complete
