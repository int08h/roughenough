# task-9 - Create Contributor Documentation

## Description

Establish clear guidelines and templates for contributors to understand how to participate in the project. Comprehensive contributor documentation reduces friction for new contributors and ensures consistent, high-quality contributions. 

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] CONTRIBUTING.md exists in the repository root
- [x] CONTRIBUTING.md includes development environment setup instructions
- [x] CONTRIBUTING.md documents how to run tests, benchmarks, and fuzzing
- [x] CONTRIBUTING.md defines coding standards and style guide
- [x] CONTRIBUTING.md documents commit message conventions
- [x] CONTRIBUTING.md explains PR submission process
- [x] CONTRIBUTING.md describes how to report bugs
- [x] CONTRIBUTING.md describes how to request features
- [x] Templates created in .github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md for any request (bug, feature, PR, etc.)

## Implementation Plan

1. Review existing content in README and CLAUDE.md for contributor-relevant information
2. Create CONTRIBUTING.md with comprehensive sections:
   - Introduction and welcome message
   - Development environment setup
   - Testing, benchmarking, coverage, and fuzzing (move from README)
   - Coding standards and style guide
   - Unsafe code policy (move from README)
   - Commit message conventions
   - Pull request submission process
   - Bug reporting process
   - Feature request process
3. Create GitHub issue templates in .github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/
   - Bug report template
   - Feature request template
   - Pull request template
4. Update README to remove duplicated content and reference CONTRIBUTING.md
5. Verify all acceptance criteria are satisfied
6. Add implementation notes and mark task complete

## Implementation Notes

### Approach Taken

Created comprehensive contributor documentation to lower the barrier for new contributors and establish clear project standards:

1. Reviewed existing README and CLAUDE.md to identify contributor-relevant content
2. Created CONTRIBUTING.md with all required sections
3. Moved development-related content (testing, benchmarking, fuzzing, coverage) from README to CONTRIBUTING.md
4. Moved unsafe code policy from README to CONTRIBUTING.md for better context
5. Created GitHub issue templates for standardized reporting
6. Updated README to reference CONTRIBUTING.md

### Features Implemented

**CONTRIBUTING.md** (comprehensive contributor guide):
- Getting Started: Prerequisites, setup, and verification steps
- Development Workflow: Testing (unit, integration, all features), benchmarking (with baseline comparison), code coverage, fuzzing
- Coding Standards: Rust style guide, unsafe code policy (no-unsafe with documented exceptions), documentation requirements, testing requirements
- Commit Message Conventions: Format, guidelines, and examples
- Pull Request Process: 6-step workflow from branch creation to merge
- Bug Reporting: Guidelines and requirements for quality bug reports
- Feature Requests: Template and considerations for feature proposals
- Project Structure: Overview of all crates and directories
- Additional Resources: Links to protocol docs and implementation guides

**GitHub Templates**:
- `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug_report.md`: Structured bug report with environment info, reproduction steps, and context
- `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/feature_request.md`: Feature proposal with problem statement, alternatives, benefits, and implementation details
- `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md`: PR checklist covering description, testing, code quality, and documentation

**README.md Updates**:
- Removed "Development" section (moved to CONTRIBUTING.md)
- Removed "Unsafe Code" subsection (moved to CONTRIBUTING.md)
- Added "Documentation" section linking to all doc files
- Updated "Contributing" section to reference CONTRIBUTING.md with bulleted overview

### Technical Decisions

- Moved development workflow content from README to CONTRIBUTING.md to keep README focused on users rather than contributors
- Included emphasis on benchmarking skepticism and data-driven performance validation (aligned with CLAUDE.md guidance)
- Used YAML frontmatter in issue templates for GitHub integration (name, about, title, labels)
- Created PR template in `.github/` root (not in ISSUE_TEMPLATE/) per GitHub conventions
- Preserved unsafe code policy but moved to CONTRIBUTING.md for better context with coding standards
- Added "Willingness to Contribute" section to feature requests to encourage participation

### Modified Files

- CONTRIBUTING.md: Created (283 lines)
- .github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug_report.md: Created
- .github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/feature_request.md: Created
- .github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md: Created
- README.md: Removed Development section and Unsafe Code subsection, updated Contributing section to reference CONTRIBUTING.md
- tasks/task-9 - Create Contributor Documentation.md: Added implementation plan and notes, marked all acceptance criteria complete
