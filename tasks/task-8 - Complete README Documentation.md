# task-8 - Complete README Documentation

## Description

Transform the README from a placeholder into comprehensive documentation that provides new users and contributors with a clear understanding of the project, its features, and how to get started. The README is the first impression for potential users and contributors, so it must be complete and professional.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Replace "TODO..." with comprehensive project description
- [x] Add project status badges (build status, codecov, crates.io version)
- [x] Include quickstart guide for running server and client
- [x] Add "Features" section highlighting key capabilities
- [x] Document system requirements and dependencies
- [x] Include architecture overview or link to detailed docs
- [x] Add examples of common use cases
- [x] Document all optional features (reporting, KMS backends, etc.)
- [x] Link to RFC specification and protocol documentation

## Implementation Plan

1. Research existing project structure and documentation
   - Review CLAUDE.md for project overview and architecture
   - Examine Cargo.toml workspace structure
   - Review crate-level documentation
   - Check for existing doc files (RFC, PROTECTION, etc.)
2. Draft comprehensive README sections
   - Project overview and description
   - Badges (build, coverage, crates.io)
   - Features overview
   - Quick start guide
   - Architecture summary
   - Examples and use cases
   - Requirements and dependencies
   - Optional features documentation
   - Links to detailed documentation
3. Verify all acceptance criteria are satisfied
4. Add implementation notes and mark task complete

## Implementation Notes

### Approach Taken

Transformed the minimal placeholder README into comprehensive documentation by:
1. Researching project structure through CLAUDE.md, Cargo.toml, and crate manifests
2. Reviewing existing documentation files (RFC-PROTOCOL.md, PROTECTION.md, etc.)
3. Analyzing GitHub Actions workflow to identify appropriate badges
4. Creating structured sections covering all acceptance criteria

### Features Implemented

**Badges**: Added build status (GitHub Actions) and codecov badges. Omitted crates.io badge as the project has not yet been published to crates.io.

**Content Sections**:
- Project description explaining Roughtime protocol and its security benefits
- Features section highlighting 8 key capabilities
- Quick Start with system requirements, installation, and usage examples for server/client
- Architecture overview with 8-crate workspace structure and links to detailed docs
- Optional Features documentation covering client reporting and keys crate backends
- Examples for common use cases (multi-server queries, key generation, integration tests)
- Development section with testing, benchmarking, coverage, and fuzzing commands
- Documentation links to all existing doc files
- Contributing and licensing sections preserved from original

### Technical Decisions

- Organized content in logical progression: overview -> features -> quick start -> architecture -> advanced topics
- Linked to existing documentation rather than duplicating content
- Included both conceptual explanations and practical commands
- Preserved original license and contribution sections unchanged

### Modified Files

- README.md: Complete rewrite from 25 lines to 316 lines
- tasks/task-8 - Complete README Documentation.md: Added implementation plan and notes, marked all acceptance criteria complete
