# task-18 - Resolve Publication Blockers

## Description

Address critical issues preventing publication to crates.io that were identified during publication readiness verification. The current crate names conflict with existing packages on crates.io, and package configurations need adjustments to meet publication requirements. Resolving these blockers is necessary to enable successful publication of all workspace crates.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] All crate names are unique and do not conflict with existing crates.io packages
- [ ] All workspace crates successfully pass `cargo publish --dry-run` without errors
- [ ] License files are included in all published packages
- [ ] Inter-crate dependencies correctly reference renamed crates with proper versions
- [ ] All code compiles successfully after crate renaming
- [ ] All tests pass after crate renaming
- [ ] Integration test passes with renamed crates
- [ ] Documentation reflects updated crate names
- [ ] Binary names in [[bin]] sections are appropriate for the new crate names
