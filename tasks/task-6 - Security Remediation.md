# task-6 - Security Remediation

## Description

Remove all secrets and API keys from the repository and its history to prevent unauthorized access and ensure the repository can be safely made public. The .env file containing a Gemini API key was committed in the repository history and must be completely removed before public release.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Gemini API key in .env is rotated via Google Cloud Console
- [x] .env file is added to .gitignore
- [x] .env file is removed from git history (N/A - never in master or pushed branches)
- [x] Verify no other secrets or API keys exist in repository history
- [x] SECURITY.md file created with vulnerability reporting process

## Implementation Plan

1. Add .env to .gitignore to prevent future commits
2. Remove .env from git history using git-filter-repo
3. Search repository history for other potential secrets (API keys, tokens, passwords)
4. Create SECURITY.md with vulnerability disclosure policy
5. Update task file with implementation notes

## Implementation Notes

### Security Assessment

Investigation revealed that .env file was only committed to local branch `refactor/simplify-server` (commit 4e5c633) which was never pushed to remote. The master branch and all remote branches have no history of .env or the API key. Therefore, no git history rewriting was necessary.

### Actions Taken

1. **API Key Rotation**: User confirmed Gemini API key was rotated via Google Cloud Console
2. **Gitignore Update**: Added .env to .gitignore under "Environment variables and secrets" section
3. **History Scan**: Searched entire git history for secrets using multiple patterns:
   - API key patterns (api_key, api-key, etc.)
   - Google API key format (AIza...)
   - AWS secrets
   - Private key patterns
   - No actual secrets found beyond the .env in unpushed local branch
4. **Security Policy**: Created SECURITY.md 

### Modified Files

- `refactor/simplify-server` - deleted the branch
- `.gitignore` - Added .env to prevent future commits
- `SECURITY.md` - Created vulnerability reporting and security policy documentation
- `tasks/task-6 - Security Remediation.md` - This file

### Recommendations

1. Ensure .env is never committed by checking git status before commits
2. Consider using a tool like git-secrets or pre-commit hooks to prevent secret commits
