# task-15 - Enhance CI-CD Pipeline

## Description

Strengthen the CI/CD pipeline to automatically enforce code quality standards and catch issues before they are merged. A robust CI/CD pipeline ensures consistent quality and reduces the burden on maintainers during code review.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Add clippy check to CI that fails on warnings
- [x] Add rustfmt check to CI
- [x] Add security audit check (cargo-audit)
- [x] Add dependency license check
- [ ] Add separate workflow for fuzzing (nightly) - Removed per user request
- [ ] Add workflow for benchmarking (with performance regression detection) - Removed per user request
- [x] Add workflow to validate examples compile
- [x] Add workflow to check documentation builds without warnings
- [x] Configure Dependabot for automated dependency updates

## Implementation Plan

1. Review existing CI/CD configuration in .github/workflows/rust.yml
2. Enhance main rust.yml workflow with:
   - Clippy check job that fails on warnings
   - Rustfmt check job that enforces code formatting
   - Security audit job using cargo-audit
   - Dependency license check job using cargo-deny
3. Create workflow for examples validation (examples.yml):
   - Compile all examples to ensure they build
   - Run examples where possible
4. Create workflow for documentation (docs.yml):
   - Build documentation with --no-deps to catch warnings
   - Ensure all public items are documented
5. Configure Dependabot:
   - Create .github/dependabot.yml
   - Set up automated dependency updates for Cargo
   - Configure update frequency and PR limits
6. Test all workflows locally or via GitHub Actions
7. Update task file with Implementation Notes
8. Remove benchmark and fuzzing workflows per user request

## Implementation Notes

### Approach Taken

Enhanced the CI/CD pipeline with comprehensive quality gates and automated checks. All workflows are designed to run in parallel where possible to minimize CI execution time.

### Features Implemented

1. **Enhanced rust.yml workflow**:
   - Added four new parallel jobs: clippy, rustfmt, security-audit, and license-check
   - Clippy job runs with `-D warnings` to fail on any warnings
   - Rustfmt job uses nightly toolchain for consistent formatting
   - Security audit uses cargo-audit to check for known vulnerabilities
   - License check uses cargo-deny to enforce license compliance

2. **Created examples.yml workflow**:
   - Validates that all examples compile successfully
   - Iterates through all crates with examples directories
   - Builds with all features enabled

3. **Created docs.yml workflow**:
   - Builds documentation with `RUSTDOCFLAGS=-D warnings` to fail on documentation warnings
   - Builds with `--no-deps` to focus on project documentation
   - Includes `--document-private-items` for comprehensive internal documentation
   - Uploads documentation as artifacts for master branch commits

4. **Created deny.toml configuration**:
   - Configured to allow common permissive licenses (MIT, Apache-2.0, BSD variants, ISC)
   - Explicitly denies copyleft licenses (GPL, AGPL) to prevent licensing conflicts
   - Warns on multiple versions of the same dependency
   - Enforces use of crates.io registry only

5. **Created dependabot.yml configuration**:
   - Weekly updates on Mondays at 3 AM
   - Groups patch updates to reduce PR noise
   - Ignores major version updates for stability
   - Handles both Cargo dependencies and GitHub Actions
   - Limits concurrent PRs to prevent overwhelming maintainers

6. **Benchmark and fuzzing workflows removed**:
   - Initially created benchmarks.yml for performance regression tracking
   - Initially created fuzzing.yml for daily fuzzing tests
   - Both removed per user request to simplify CI pipeline

### Technical Decisions and Trade-offs

- **Parallel jobs**: Separated quality checks into independent jobs to run in parallel, reducing overall CI time
- **Nightly for formatting**: Used nightly toolchain for rustfmt to ensure consistent formatting
- **License policy**: Permissive licenses only to avoid licensing complications for users
- **Dependabot grouping**: Groups patch updates to reduce PR volume while keeping minor/major updates separate for review
- **Simplified pipeline**: Removed benchmark and fuzzing workflows to reduce maintenance overhead
