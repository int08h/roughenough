//! An implementation of the [Roughtime](https://roughtime.googlesource.com/roughtime)
//! secure time synchronization protocol.
//!
//! Roughtime aims to achieve rough time synchronisation in a secure way that doesn't 
//! depend on any particular time server, and in such a way that, if a time server does 
//! misbehave, clients end up with cryptographic proof of it. 
//!
//! # Protocol
//!
//! Roughtime messages are represetned by [`RtMessage`](struct.RtMessage.html) which 
//! implements the mapping of Roughtime `u32` [`tags`](enum.Tag.html) to byte-strings.
//!
//! # Client
//!
//! A Roughtime client can be found in `src/bin/client.rs`. To run the client:
//!
//! ```bash
//! $ cargo run --release --bin client roughtime.int08h.com 2002
//! ```
//!
//! Consult the client's `--help` output for all runtime options.
//!
//! # Server
//!
//! A Roughtime server implementation is in `src/bin/server.rs`. The server is 
//! configured via a yaml file:
//!
//! ```yaml
//! interface: 127.0.0.1
//! port: 8686
//! seed: f61075c988feb9cb700a4a6a3291bfbc9cab11b9c9eca8c802468eb38a43d7d3
//! ```
//!
//! Where:
//!
//!   * **interface** - IP address or interface name for listening to client requests
//!   * **port** - UDP port to listen to requests
//!   * **seed** - A 32-byte hexadecimal value used as the seed to generate the 
//!                server's long-term key pair. **This is a secret value**, treat it
//!                with care.
//!
//! To run the server:
//!
//! ```bash
//! $ cargo run --release --bin server /path/to/config.file
//! ```
//!
